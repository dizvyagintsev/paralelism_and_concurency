# Multiprocessing, Multithreading, and asyncio in Python

Python offers three distinct methods to execute multiple pieces of code simultaneously: multiprocessing, multithreading, and asyncio. Each method has its advantages, disadvantages, and ideal use cases.

## 1. Multiprocessing

### Introduction

Imagine you have two large dataframes and you need to perform resource-intensive operations on them. If you process them sequentially, it will take a significant amount of time.

```python
[script1]
```

A simple solution is to write two separate scripts, each handling one dataframe:

```python
[script2]
[script3]
```

You can run these scripts simultaneously, without waiting for the first to complete. Once both scripts finish, you can gather the results and proceed. Essentially, this is the concept of multiprocessing. When you start a Python script, you initiate a process. Each process has its own memory space, containing its variables, constants, functions, and imported modules.

### Spawning Processes in Python

Manually running multiple scripts and collecting results is not feasible, especially with more than two dataframes. Python provides tools to spawn processes and share data between them:

```python
[script4]
```

To facilitate communication between parent and child processes, we use pipes. Data is serialized (or pickled) for interprocess communication. Serialization can be resource-intensive, especially for complex data structures. 

Processes are distinguished by creating a unique pipe for each. The `process.start` method spawns a child process, which runs in a new Python interpreter. It's crucial to use the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard to prevent infinite loops of process creation.

After executing the child processes, results are retrieved using pipes. The `recv` method is blocking, meaning it waits for data. If a child process doesn't send data, the parent process will be indefinitely blocked. It's essential to ensure child processes complete, or they become orphaned processes.

While multiprocessing can significantly speed up code execution, process creation can be resource-intensive. It's advisable to minimize data serialization and consider storing results in a file or database. Another way to optimize is by using the fork start method, which is faster but considered less safe.

```python
[script5]
```

### Using Multiprocessing Pools

For simplifying process management, Python offers `multiprocessing.Pools`. Pools handle interprocess communication and allow process reuse, conserving resources:

```python
[script6]
```

To compare the efficiency of the fork and spawn methods:

```python
[script7]
```

### Determining the Number of Processes

The maximum number of processes is determined by `os.cpu_count()`, which returns the number of logical CPUs. However, memory constraints also play a role. Excessive memory usage can lead to swapping, severely degrading performance. The `psutil` library can help monitor memory consumption:

```python
[script8]
```

### Handling Exceptions

If a child process raises an exception, it will propagate when attempting to retrieve the result:

```python
[script9]
```

### Locks

Locks ensure that only one process accesses a resource at a time:

```python
[script10]
```

```

Note: I've corrected the spelling and grammar, and also fixed the typo in the script reference `[scritp10]` to `[script10]`.
